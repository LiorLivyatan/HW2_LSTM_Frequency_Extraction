# LSTM Frequency Extraction Configuration
# This configuration file controls all hyperparameters and paths for the pipeline

# Data Generation
data:
  frequencies: [1, 3, 5, 7]  # Hz - the 4 frequencies to extract
  sampling_rate: 1000         # Hz - 1000 samples per second
  duration: 10.0              # seconds - 10 seconds of signal
  train_seed: 1               # Random seed for training set
  test_seed: 2                # Random seed for test set (different noise)
  data_dir: "data"

# Model Architecture
model:
  input_size: 5               # S(t) + 4-dim one-hot selector
  hidden_size: 128            # LSTM hidden dimension (doubled from 64 for capacity)
  num_layers: 1               # Single LSTM layer
  dropout: 0.0                # No dropout for single layer

# Training
training:
  learning_rate: 0.0001       # Adam learning rate (reduced from 0.001)
  num_epochs: 100             # Training epochs
  batch_size: 1               # CRITICAL: Must be 1 for L=1 constraint
  clip_grad_norm: 1.0         # Gradient clipping for stability
  device: "auto"              # auto, cpu, or cuda
  save_dir: "models"

# Evaluation
evaluation:
  generalization_threshold: 0.1  # 10% - maximum acceptable difference between train/test MSE

# Visualization
visualization:
  comparison_freq_idx: 1      # f₂ = 3Hz (0-indexed)
  time_window: 1000           # First 1 second (1000 samples)
  dpi: 300                    # Publication quality
  output_dir: "outputs/graphs"
